01_scrape_tes_names.R - was moved here after creation of 01_scrape_lore_names.R
This script scrapes names from game specific pages that go over NPC characters
However, I found out that there was another page that had the names more readily available and more of them
The only downside is sometimes their full name is not listed, however these can be extracted from the link on the newly found page

02_clean_npc_names.R - a scrip that accompanies 01_scrape_tes_names.R
Cleans the data from step 1, but this is no longer needed as step 1 is in archive
